UPDATE:
added MasterX9 Projects ( DirectX 9 ), with backwards compatibility headers
to compile old MasterX Projects with DirectX 9.


--------------------------------------------------

Some old MasterX apps are located in this directory
I use mingw32 on ubuntu linux to compile
simply change the varaibles in the Makefiles to your cross compiler and set flags

if your on windows using cygwin then use the Makefile with the .cyg extension
example


make -f Makefile.cyg
